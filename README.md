This is the readme file, welcome to my project!!

My project starts showing what git is and then talking about why github is the bomb stuff 

// create a dev branch :)
// create a feature branch from dev and add better html so we can see:
// -h1 saying hello welcome to my website
// -h2 with a description of what we've done
// from feature branch create pull request to dev
// sync all branches in origin and locally
// pull request from dev to master

// show our html on a chrome browser :)
